This is sad for me because that reduces my reasons to go outside and take a break from work. Do not get me wrong, I understand the\n            need behind self lockdown, but there is also part of me that feels staying cooped inside forever is poison to the body. That is why I decided to create a schedule where I do the dance exercises found on YouTube and also replaced\n            my desk chair with a yoga ball.\n            <br />\n            Previously, I mentioned that classwork gets done quickly because of online courses. With that, I have gained more free time because there is no need to dedicate time for transportation. I have been able to draw and do some\n            coloring more, constructed some models that I was not able to before, and started studying for classes that I plan to take next semester since I fear courses are going to be online too next semester.\n            <br />\n            We have just finished 25 percent of the year 2020 and it has taken the biggest hit compared to what I have seen in the last 21 years of my life. This pandemic has required me to be alone which is a good thing because there are\n            many things I notice. For instance, having a horrible supervisor gives me the practice of what not to become when I take a leadership position. The emphasis on staying clean is found too. But, I feel like we are far from over\n            with this global pandemic. I feel like the worst that has to come from this has yet to come.\n            <br />\n          </p>\n        </Container>\n        <div className=\"push\" />\n      </Container>\n\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Covid;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
