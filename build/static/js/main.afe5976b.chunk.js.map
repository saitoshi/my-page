href=\"http://www.hei.com/\"> Hawaii Electric Industries </a> on creating an application that allows users to see their Green House Gases. The students were grouped into four teams of 6-7 people. The team I worked on was called “Shocking Development” and the application we created was called “Shocking Emissions”.\n          <ul>\n            <li>For the Github <a href =\"https://github.com/shocking-development/shockingdevelopment\">Repository</a></li>\n            <li> For the Project Group <a href = \"https://shocking-development.github.io/\">Page</a></li>\n          </ul>\n            <Image src={\"https://shocking-development.github.io/doc/landingPageM4.png\"} size='large' centered/>\n          <div className=\"comment\">The landing page of Shocking Emissions.</div>\n            <u><b> Contributions to Shocking Emissions</b></u>\n            <br/>\n            The different issues that were worked on for the projects were broken down into Milestones. Roughly every milestone was done in two weeks.\n            <br/>\n            <b> <a href =\"https://github.com/shocking-development/shockingdevelopment/projects/1\"> Milestone 1 </a></b> <br/>\n            For Milestone 1, I created the basic mock up on what each page should look like and then created an initial design on\n            the profile, log in, register (sign up) pages. <br/>\n            <b> <a href=\"https://github.com/shocking-development/shockingdevelopment/projects/2\"> Milestone 2</a></b>\n            <br/>\n            For Milestone 2, I participated in a group review and helped out with the profile database.\n            <br/>\n            <b><a href=\"https://github.com/shocking-development/shockingdevelopment/projects/3\"> Milestone 3</a></b>\n            <br/>\n            For Milestone 3, I particpated in another group review, made fix ups on the profile page where the profile card\n            shows the user's profile image, modified the edit profile page to have the image column, and finally modified\n            the admin capabilities.\n            <br/>\n            <b><a href=\"https://github.com/shocking-development/shockingdevelopment/projects/4\">Milestone 4</a></b><br/>\n            By Milestone 4, 90% of the application was set and running. At this stage each members were adding small modifications\n            to improve the application. My contribution was that I added an option so users can change units from US units to Metric System units.\n            <br/>\n            <b><a href=\"https://github.com/shocking-development/shockingdevelopment/projects/5\">Milestone 5</a></b>\n            <br/>\n            At Milestone 5, the group goal was to deploy the project to Digital Ocean and input some sample datas for multiple test users.\n            To create the fake data of users and the green house gas usages, the group created a random generator using\n            <a href= \"https://www.npmjs.com/package/faker\">Faker.js</a> where 20+ fake users and for each user 3 months of fake but beliveable data was created.\n            <br/>\n            <b><a href=\"https://github.com/shocking-development/shockingdevelopment/projects/6\">Milestone 6</a></b>\n            <br/>\n            For the last milestone, the main goal was to clean up the codes or functions on the application. For instance, I checked to see whether the files had appropriate comments or not. Additionally, per request of the customer a contact to Admin page was created.\n            <br/>\n            <Image src={\"https://saitoshi.github.io/images/shockingemissions.gif\"} size='large' centered />\n            <div className=\"comment\">The sample gif of the application itself.</div>\n            <u><b>Challeges to the Project</b></u>\n            <ul>\n              <li> <b> Time Management </b> <br/></li>\n              Unlike ICS 314, this course worked on a single project for one semester long. While one semester might look like a long time, because of taking other courses it flew by fast. Furthermore, since there was a semester to work on the application, there was no excuse to perfect it.\n              Therefore, time management was an important thing. One way was that our group took the milestone to our advantage by making milestone goals. For instance, milestone 1 had a goal to perfect the design or milestone 5 had a goal to perfect the fake data and its display.\n              <li> <b> Communication</b></li>\n              Since most of the communication was done through Discord using words, I had to be clear and concise on what I wanted to say. Especially, with a group so big that becomes important as a single small miscommunication may mess up any progress.\n              <li> <b> Awkward Silences</b></li>\n              With work being online, there are moments of “Awkward Silences”. However, I believe that they are a waste of time. To avoid silence during group meetings, I tried to ask questions or start a conversation to see which areas need to be worked on.\n            </ul>\n            <Image src={\"https://saitoshi.github.io/images/discord.png\"} size='large' centered/>\n            <div className=\"comment\">A screenshot of the group Discord chat server.</div>\n            <br/>\n            <u><b>Take Back From ICS 414</b></u>\n            <br/>\n            Despite going to school for a certain period, I have never worked in a large group. With the pandemic making this semester online, I have expected some issues to happen. However, the major issues that I have expected never happened. What my group did was set two meetings per week at a time where all of us could meet. Additionally, we created a Discord server for the team to do either word or voice chats.\n            <br/>\n            Furthermore, with the class being held online I personally think that it helped me to prepare for after graduation. I do expect the pandemic to continue, therefore, forcing things to remain online.\n            <br/>\n            Another factor that made the course helpful is because we had a customer. While the future is uncertain, I do expect that I will have to build applications based on customer preferences. Previously, I worked on projects based on requirements on a syllabus or instructor’s guidelines. However, by having a customer, frequent communications needed to be made to truly understand their expectations of the product.\n      <div class=\"push\">\n      </div>\n\n</p>\n        </Container>\n        <div className=\"push\"/>\n        </Container>\n\n\n\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Shocking;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport '../style.css';\nimport { Header, Container, Grid, Image } from 'semantic-ui-react';\n\nfunction TextbookHunt() {\n  return (\n      <Container>\n        <br/>\n        <Header as =\"h2\" textAlign=\"center\">Textbook Hunt</Header>\n        <Grid textAlign = \"center\">\n          <p textAlign=\"center\"> Software Engineering, Meteor, React</p>\n          <br/>\n        </Grid>\n        <Container text>\n          <hr/>\n          <p>\n            <b><u>OVERVIEW OF ICS 314</u></b>\n            <br/>\n            ICS 314 is the first semester and introduction course of Software Engineering. The first half of the semester consisted it of learning JavaScript and other Software Engineering facts.\n            <br/>\n            To finish of the semester with ICS 314, the professor in charge breaks students into groups of 3 to 5 people to create an application using Meteor, React, JavaScript, and other tools that were taught in the course over the semester. Textbook Hunt, an application that the group I participated was created so college students can sell used textbooks and purchase textbooks for a reasonable price.\n            <br/>\n            <ul>\n              <li> For the GitHub Repository <a href = \"https://github.com/textbookhunt/textbookhunt\">page</a></li>\n              <li> For the GitHub Organization <a href =\"https://textbookhunt.github.io/\">Page</a></li>\n            </ul>\n            <Image src={\"https://saitoshi.github.io/images/textbookhunt.png\"} size='large' centered />\n\n            <b> Project Contribution </b> <br/>\n            As mentioned previously, the purpose of this project was to practice the tools and methods on what we learned over the semester and applying proper teamwork ethics. Especially, with COIVD-19 lock down going, communication was essential. For this project, our team created issues or tasks to do where every week we sign up the one we are able or willing to do.\n            <br/>\n            <b> Week 1 Tasks </b> <br/>\n            For the first week, I have set up the page where students can sign up their books to sell and a page where it lists the possible textbooks that students can see that are on sale. To take a good look on what I was assigned, feel free to visit Milestone 1.\n            <br/>\n            <b> Week 2 Tasks </b> <br/>\n            For the second week, I have set up the advanced settings of what I did in the first week. For example, making the display cleaner and organized and have the navigation bar move as the user scrolls down the page.\n            <br/>\n            <b> Week 3 Tasks </b> <br/>\n            For the third week, I have cleaned up the final things such as moving the comments section and creating an Admin access where the admin can delete and edit books that might not seem appropriate.\n            <br/>\n            Overall by participating in this project, I have learned better scheduling. Since this project was assigned during the COVID-19 lock down, I had to create an efficient schedule and remind myself that time will only run out and continue working. Additionally, I have found a way to communicate to my team members without making them mad or furious.\n            <div class=\"push\">\n            </div>\n\n          </p>\n        </Container>\n        <div className=\"push\"/>\n      </Container>\n\n\n\n  );\n}\n\nexport default TextbookHunt;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport '../style.css';\nimport { Header, Container, Grid, Image } from 'semantic-ui-react';\n\nfunction Tregear() {\n  return (\n      <Container>\n        <br/>\n        <Header as =\"h2\" textAlign=\"center\">Tregear Translation Story</Header>\n        <Grid textAlign = \"center\">\n          <p textAlign=\"center\"> Japanese, Translation</p>\n          <br/>\n        </Grid>\n        <Container text>\n          <hr/>\n          <p>\n            <b><u>OVERVIEW OF JPN 425</u></b>\n            <br/>\n            JPN 425 is a translation course centered around translating Japanese writing into English.

Star allows you to register for courses, pay for your tuition, scholarship, and see your current academic standings. However, as a STEM, especially as an ICS student there are moments where you feel Star is not enough. Star does not provide internship details or in-depth recommended career paths. To support the many flaws, an ICS student has RadGrad. This application provides ICS students ways on how they can attain their career goals, a list of courses they should take, and many more. Additionally, it has a level and point system like Pokemon providing an incentive to do better. Despite the many strength, because of the “Ying and Yang” rule, there are some weaknesses that RadGrad struggles in.\n            <Image src={\"https://www.radgrad.org/assets/images/ice-example-b89aedaa1bd783119aca969f47745f02.png\"} size='large' centered/>\n            <div className=\"comment\"> A screenshot of a page from RadGrad</div>\n            <h4> Strength </h4>\n            <ol>\n              <li> <span class = \"bold-list\">Priority List System</span></li>\n              The things that are necessary and not are organized neatly. Furthermore, within each card that needs action a simple explanation on how to fix is provided making it easier for user to fix or update.\n              <li><span class =\"bold-list\"> Course Page</span> </li>\n              The course page is automatically set up; therefore, users do not have to manually add courses one by one. However, students still have the ability to manually add courses based on their interests. Which is helpful to student to schedule out their future semesters more effectively than Star.\n            </ol>\n            <h4> Weakness </h4>\n            Here are some of the following the current RadGrad system tends to be weak at.\n            <ol>\n              <li><span className=\"bold-list\">Consistency</span></li>\n              The current application lacks in the area of design consistency. For instance, within the  opportunities page the usage of bold font is inconsistent. For example, Amazon Web Service has its name bolded whereas Android or IOS does not. From a personal opinion, if one is bolded maybe, it is better to do so for the others.\n              <Image src={\"https://saitoshi.github.io/images/title.png\"} size='medium' centered/>\n\n              <div className=\"comment\">Inconsistent formatting in titles.</div>\n              <br/>\n              Another example is that some buttons have auto-translations on despite everything else is in English. For instance, on the student review pages, the submit button for me is written in Japanese kanji rather than English. While making assumptions goes against my mathematical background, I assume that most of the RadGrad users will understand what submit is. Therefore, consistency should be applied to the language area too.\n              <Image src={\"https://saitoshi.github.io/images/submit.png\"} size='medium' centered/>\n              <div className=\"comment\">Everything else but submit is in English.</div>\n              <li><span className=\"bold-list\">Filter or Search Function</span></li>\n              As of right now, RadGrad has a good search function, but I still think it is not as user-friendly as it could be. For example, in the Interest Page, maybe the varieties listed could be filter based on the category of its interest. For instance, Java, C, or Python could be programming languages whereas others could be different. Additionally, something similar to this could be added to the Career Page also. Having a stronger search function makes users to condense their time spent on the app and they may explore other features available.\n              <Image src={\"https://saitoshi.github.io/images/filter.png\"} size='large' centered/>\n              <div className=\"comment\">Add more ways to filter through the different choices.</div>\n              <li><span className=\"bold-list\">Student Planner</span></li>\n              Currently, it is said that Student Planner should be a reflection on the registered information on Star. However, as of right now it contains ICS courses that I have no recollection of registering both on Star or RadGrad, The other case would be that I have registered to take a certain course next semester, but it is claiming that I a repeating a certain course. For instance, I am registered for ICS 313 in Fall 2021, but on RadGrad’s student planner it is listed that I took it in the Spring 2021 and will take it again in the Fall.\n              <Image src={\"https://saitoshi.github.io/images/duplicate.png\"} size='large' centered/>\n              <div className=\"comment\">A duplicate ICS 313 and additional courses that I have not taken.</div>\n              <li><span className=\"bold-list\">Deletion Whiteout</span></li>\n              When I deleted the internship from Student Planner, while it successfully deletes it from the page it whitens out the page. Even though page comes back after reloading it, I think this is an area that should be fixed for convinient usages.\n              <Image src={\"https://saitoshi.github.io/images/duplicate.png\"} size='medium' centered/>\n            </ol>\n            <h4> Areas For Growth Opportunity </h4>\n            Despite the strength and weakness listed above, there are many areas in which can be improved upon.\n            <ol>\n              <li><span className=\"bold-list\"> Adding a Column For Class Environment</span></li>\n              With the upcoming Fall 2021 semester, the school is gradually transitioning back to an in-person environment. However, that implies that there is going to be a mixture, of course, such as in-person, hybrid, and online. In addition, online even has its subcategory of synchronous and asynchronous courses. For instance, my ICS 321 course in Spring 2021 was online asynchronous but in Fall 2021, ICS 485 is scheduled to be in person or at least staggered.\n              Furthermore, from personal experience, I was advised by Gerald Lau to take ICS 212 at Leeward Community College. Therefore, maybe when students are adding reviews another dropdown could be added to indicate the campus or if they took it at Manoa or not. That way prospective students can have a better idea on whether which campus they should take courses at.\n              <Image src={\"https://saitoshi.github.io/images/dropdown.png\"} size='large' centered/>\n              <div className=\"comment\">Probably could add a dropdown of campus option between term and satisfaction.\n              </div>\n              <li><span className=\"bold-list\">Separate Teaching and Tutoring</span></li>\n              On the course planner page, Teaching and Tutoring are categorized as one of the same things. While this may sound more personal, I have a feeling that they are two different things. From a personal opinion, I see teaching covering one subject versus tutoring cover multiple subjects. Especially, with the Learning Assistant Program expanding, maybe it might be effective to separate the two into two bars. Furthermore, we might be able to add the growing Learning Assistant Program.\n              <Image src={\"https://saitoshi.github.io/images/tutor.png\"} size='large' centered/>\n              <div className=\"comment\">A sample block of the Teaching or Tutoring block.</div>\n              <li><span className=\"bold-list\">Verification Process</span></li>\n              It is better to believe in the goodness of people there are people who are rotten and will cheat out of a system. Maybe when students are typing for the verification process for an internship, there could be a box that asks for the supervisor’s email or contact information. That way the RadGrad staff can verify just to be safe.\n              <Image src={\"https://saitoshi.github.io/images/verification.png\"} size='large' centered/>\n              <li><span className=\"bold-list\">Missing ICS courses</span></li>\n              On the student planner and the courses list, there are few ICS courses that are missing that I have either taken or registered for. For instance, I am planning to take ICS 427 this Summer and ICS 496 Capstone Project on the Fall 2021. However, the selection of these two courses are nowhere to be found.\n              <Image src={\"https://saitoshi.github.io/images/427.png\"} size='large' centered/>\n              <div className=\"comment\">The missing ICS 427 I am going to take for Summer 2021.</div>\n            </ol>\n            <br/>\n            <h3>Benefits of Reviews</h3>\n            Living in the era of \"positive wokeness\", people tend to not point out flaws in both people and objects. However, in a professional manner, I think it is neccessary to point out flaws. Having flaws means that there is opportunity for growth.\n            For example, finding the area of errors that the current deployed RadGrad right now can grow the user happiness. Why? It is beause these errors are fixed before the general usage. When users are happy using the system, it means that the application is doing a good job. Therefore, pointing out the area of errors and improvement is a neccesary thing. Without it nothing can change.\n            </p>\n        </Container>\n        <div className=\"push\"/>\n      </Container>\n\n\n  );\n}\n\nexport default RadGradReview;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { Header, Container, Grid, Image } from 'semantic-ui-react';\nimport '../style.css';\n\nfunction RadGradFeedback() {\n  return (\n      <Container>\n        <br/>\n        <Header as =\"h2\" textAlign=\"center\">RadGrad Grad Feedback</Header>\n        <Grid textAlign = \"center\">\n          <p>RadGrad, Summer Intern, Software Engineering</p>\n        </Grid>\n        <Grid textAlign = \"center\">\n          <p><span className=\"bold-list\">May 20, 2021</span></p>\n        </Grid>\n        <Container text>\n          <hr/>\n          <p>\n            Life is a truly unfair and cruel place. They say if you have a dream you should be able to pursue it. However, if you do not have the right credentials, you are more likely not allowed to do otherwise. This affects many freshmen in college as they enter a STEM field. Most of them have big dreams, but because of their poor resources, many end up in despair. If only if there was a tool that provided students with assistance in Computer Science at least. Well, there is. It is called RadGrad.\n            <Image src={\"https://saitoshi.github.io/images/RadGradHome.png\"} size='large' centered />\n            <div className=\"comment\"> A screenshot of when user logs into RadGrad.</div>\n            <h4>Purpose of RadGrad</h4>\n            RadGrad is an application that provides Computer Science students an incentive to do better. To help those\n            regardless of their backgrounds such as racial, sexual, academic, etc. The application contains a degree\n            planner and a list of possible interests. For example, Computer Science alone is a vague major as it is\n            comprised of various disciplinary fields such as Data Science, Cyber Security, Software Engineering, etc.\n            Therefore, it assists students in at least two ways.\n\n            This Summer 2021 (May - August period) 5 undergraduate students under Professor Johnson and Professor Moore\n            are working on to make updates on RadGrad. The reason behind these updates are to make improvements that\n            allow more student usage. For example, open RadGrad to other STEM majors or giving access to high school\n            students.\n\n\n            <h4> Benefits On Doing RadGrad</h4>\n            Most UH students know what Star is, and because of that many might not see the benefits of RadGrad.\n            While Star may allow students to register for their courses, there are multiple ways in which RadGrad is\n            still superior.\n\n            <ul>\n              <li> <span class = \"bold-list\">Freshmen or Undecided</span></li>\n              For those who are undecided on what they would like to do specifically, RadGrad provides low-cost and investments such as clubs, events, or free workshops on different fields. Furthermore, within the different lists of interests, faculty members or staff are listed making it easier on who to talk to.\n\n              <li> <span class = \"bold-list\">Upperclassmen or Decided</span></li>\n              For those who have been decided, RadGrad also provides assistance too. For instance, it lists the different 300-400 level electives that may be helpful. For example, if a student is interested in Data Science, RadGrad can recommend ICS 435. Also, the application provides a list of internship or research opportunities that students can apply for making it a little easier.\n            </ul>\n            Rather than purely awarding students based on their GPA, RadGrad rewards based on Innovation, Competency, and Experience (ICE for short). That way students have a better incentive to do more while they are in college. With the ICE system, students can gain points and level up like a certain Nintendo game that came out in 1996.\n            <h4> Improvements For RadGrad</h4>\n            While RadGrad is superior, it still has an area for improvement. One of the major reasons is because computer science is continuously changing. In order for RadGrad to be superior to Star, it constantly needs to reflect on the changes. For instance, the ICS department now offers more courses about Data Science that have not been reflected on. While on a personal level, RadGrad also misses a component in which could recommend in what to double major or get a minor that could complement their major.\n\n            <h4> Getting Community Input </h4>\n            One way to make improvement is to get feedback. However, because of the current global situation getting feedback needs to be done in creative ways. One thing that could be done is Zoom interviews with current undergrads, high school students, graduate students, and professionals.\n            <ul>\n              <li> <span class = \"bold-list\">Undergraduates</span></li>\n              By asking current undergraduates, it allows us to see which area needs improvement. Additionally, we can ask about the things they like or dislike with the application and list it down when future updates are made.\n              <li> <span class = \"bold-list\">Graduates</span></li>\n              By talking to graduate students, the developer team can see how other Universities are doing with degree planners and probably borrow an element that may be beneficial to add.\n              <li> <span class = \"bold-list\">High School students</span></li>\n              Interviewing high school students, mainly Juniors and Seniors, getting their inputs could be beneficial as we can see what disciplinary fields are popular. Additionally, this could be one way to do an advertisement to show local students that you can get your degree locally.\n              <li> <span class = \"bold-list\">Professionals</span></li>\n              Finally, asking professionals can improve the degree planner that way students can effectively land a job they desire.\n            </ul>\n            Another way we could do this is provide a Google Forum for those who are either busy or uncomfortable to do a Zoom interview. Overall, I think a prize or reward should be provided for those who participate in these surveys to provide incentive.\n          </p>\n        </Container>\n        <div className=\"push\"/>\n      </Container>\n\n\n  );\n}\n\nexport default RadGradFeedback;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport { Header, Container, Grid, Image } from 'semantic-ui-react';\nimport '../style.css';\nimport { NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';\n\nfunction RadGradStart() {\n  return (\n      <Container>\n        <br/>\n        <Header as =\"h2\" textAlign=\"center\"> RadGrad Initial Join Up </Header>\n        <Grid textAlign = \"center\">\n          <p> RadGrad2, Summer 2021 Internship Program, Software Engineering</p>\n        </Grid>\n        <Grid textAlign=\"center\">\n          <p><span className=\"bold-list\">May 21, 2021</span></p>\n        </Grid>\n        <Container text>\n          <br/>\n          <b><u>Overview Of Issue 468 Task 6</u></b>\n          <br/>\n          As an introduction task to the first week of the RadGrad 2.0 Summer 2021 Internship, there was a list of tasks for newcomers to do. Issue 468 centered around programming tasks for us to get used to the RadGrad environment.\n          <br/>\n          <b><u>Task 1 – Hello World</u></b>\n          <br/>\n          Regardless of the country in which you learned programming; the first task is always called “Hello-World”. This was no different for the RadGrad summer 2021 interns too. Using the sandbox portion provided by Professor Johnson and Professor Moore, we began by writing “Hello-World”.\n          However, this process also allowed us to see <span className=\"bold-list\">components</span> unique to RadGrad such as “RadGradHeader” and the “RadGradSegment”.\n          Additionally, this was the first time for me to use <a href={\"https://fomantic-ui.com/\"}>Fomantic UI</a> programming assignment.\n          <Image src={'https://github.com/saitoshi/images/blob/main/radgrad-task1.png?raw=true'} size='huge' centered/>\n          <div className=\"comment\">A screenshot of the sandbox after Task 1.</div>\n          <b><u>Task 2 - User Display</u></b>\n          <br/>\n          After doing Hello World, the next task is to display the user names of the sandbox owner and the current user. To do begin, I created a component that stored the header and paragraphs in a separate component file.\n          Then using withTracker, I created two const called \"urlUser\", which stores the owner of the page and \"loggedInUser\" to store the current user by the help from meteor.\n          The challenging part for this task was grabbing the user display, but after taking a 15 minute break the solution I ended up was the following.\n          <br/>\n          <Image src={'https://github.com/saitoshi/images/blob/main/task2code.png?raw=true'} size='big' centered/>\n          <br/>\n         <div className={'comment'}>The code I wrote to display the correct users.</div>\n          To test whether the code worked I logged in as an Admin to see whether it displayed the right users. After logging in it did as it displayed radgrad@hawaii.edu as the current user and my email as the owner of the sandbox.\n          <Image src={'https://github.com/saitoshi/images/blob/main/radgrad-task2.png?raw=true'} size='huge' centered/>\n          <div className={'comment'}>A screenshot when I log in as radgrad@hawaii.edu.</div>\n          <b><u>Task 3 - Career Goal Display</u></b>\n          <br/>\n          For task 3, we had to create a career goal segment in which every time it refreshes, it displayed a new career option and its description.\n          Additionally, on the bottom it should display the total number of career choices available. <br/>\n          For this task, similar to Task 2, I created a component in which stored the basic parts required in Task 3 and in the SandBox page recreated the interface to store the consts from Task 2 and Task 3 into one area.\n          However, the difficult part was getting the consts as I had a hard time displaying the randomization of careers.\n          Initially, it would only display \"Data Science\" for me because the Career Interests when I played with RadGrad in ICS 211 was Data Science.\n          <Image src={'https://github.com/saitoshi/images/blob/main/task3.png?raw=true'} size='big' centered/>\n          <br/>\n          After talking to some teammates, I was able to modify the code so the job selections are randomized. I modified the consts on the Task3Component Typescript and then use the Random function.\n          <Image src={'https://github.com/saitoshi/images/blob/main/RadGradTask3.gif?raw=true'} size='big' centered/>\n          <div className={'comment'}>Now it displays other careers also.</div>\n          <b><u>Task 4 - RadGrad Labels</u></b><br/>\n          In Task 4, we were requested to work with the different labels available on RadGrad: CareerGoalLabel, InterestLabel, CourseLabel, OpportunityLabel, and UserLabel. To work on this task, I worked parts by parts to get a full understanding at first. To begin with, I started by creating and RadGradHeader of each part necessary: Career, Interest, Course, etc. After seeing that the skeleton of Task 4 working, I worked with the Mongo-related tasks. Initially, I started off by reading the article on the different labels given to us on the issue page. After that, I started off with the CareerGoalLabel.\n\n          I began by importing the label for Career and then used the \"map\" function to display the label as I learned both from ICS 314 and ICS 414. After getting used to with CareerLabel, I then went down the list of InterestLabel, CourseLabel, and so on.\n          Finally, working on the student or UserLabel was challenging because it was different from the previous. After using fetch as <span className=\"bold-list\">isAlumni false }, {}).fetch()</span> then I loaded the student labels.\n          <Image src={'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saitoshi/images/main/task4.png'} size='medium' centered/>\n          <b><u>Task 5 - Interests Form</u></b><br/>\n          In task 5, the assignment was to create a forum which displays all the possible interests and after the selection is made then the corresponding description is displayed. To start on this, I rewatched the screencast from Professor Johnson and looked at the project I made in\n          ICS 314 and ICS 414. After setting up the basic components: RadGrad Header and RadGrad Segment, I went with working on the the interest schema basing it off of from <NavLink exact to = \"/shocking\">ICS 414 Shocking Development Project</NavLink>.\n          <Image src={'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saitoshi/images/main/radgradtask/task5/task5code.png'} size='big' centered/>\n          <div className='comment'>The <span className=\"bold-list\">code</span> written to display the interests in the forum.</div>\n          <br/>\n          After writing out the schema, I used <span className=\"bold-list\">AutoForum, SelectField, and SubmitField</span> to make the forum to select the different interests.\n          After that, similar to Task 3 Segment, I used <span className=\"bold-list\">Markdown</span> to display the description cleanly.\n          <Image src={'https://github.com/saitoshi/images/blob/main/radgradtask/task5/RadGrad5.gif?raw=true'} size='big' centered/>\n          <div className='comment'>The sample rundown of the Task 5 interest description function.</div>\n        </Container>\n        <div className =\"push\"/>\n      </Container>\n);\n}\n\nexport default RadGradStart;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { HashRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport {\n  Navigation,\n  Home,\n  About,\n  Resume,\n  Project,\n  Essay,\n    JPN,\n  RadGrad,\n  Shocking,\n  TextbookHunt,\n  RadGradReview,\n  RadGradFeedback,\n  RadGradStart,\n  Tregear\n} from \"./components\";\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <Router>\n        <Navigation />\n        <Switch>\n          <Route path=\"/\" exact component={() => <Home />} />\n          <Route path=\"/about\" exact component={() => <About />} />\n          <Route path=\"/jpn\" exact component={() => <JPN />} />\n          <Route path=\"/resume\" exact component={() => <Resume />} />\n          <Route path=\"/project\" exact component={() => <Project />} />\n          <Route path=\"/essay\" exact component={() => <Essay />} />\n          <Route path=\"/radgrad\" exact component={() => <RadGrad />} />\n          <Route path=\"/shocking\" exact component={() => <Shocking />} />\n          <Route path=\"/radgradreview\" exact component={() => <RadGradReview />} />\n          <Route path=\"/radgradfeedback\" exact component={() => <RadGradFeedback />} />\n          <Route path=\"/radgradstart\" exact component={() => <RadGradStart />} />\n          <Route path=\"/textbookhunt\" exact component={() => <TextbookHunt />} />\n          <Route path=\"/tregear\" exact component={() => <Tregear />} />\n        </Switch>\n      </Router>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
